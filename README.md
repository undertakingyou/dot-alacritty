# Undertakingyou Alacritty config

Alacritty is a cross platform terminal emulator. In an attempt to have my
system be consistent across operating systems, I am giving this terminal
emulator a try.

## Fonts
This uses [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). See the .toml
file for details on which exact font is used.

## Setup

* Clone this directory to the `~/config/alacritty` directory.
