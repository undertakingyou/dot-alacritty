# Undertakingyou Alacritty config

Alacritty is a cross platform terminal emulator. In an attempt to have my
system be consistent across operating systems, I am giving this terminal
emulator a try.

## Setup

* Clone this directory to the `~/config/alacritty` directory.
* Make sure to get the submodules.
